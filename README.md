**Developed by:**
- **Aakash Velusamy** (23PT01)
- **Kabilan S** (23PT14)

## Overview
This project presents a **Contact Searching System** built using a **Suffix Tree** data structure. Designed for rapid and efficient searching through extensive contact lists, the system enables quick retrieval of contact names based on partial input, particularly for **prefix and substring matches**. It provides minimal latency, even with large sets of contacts.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Search Operations**  
  The Suffix Tree structure allows for fast retrieval of contact names, ensuring minimal latency during search, regardless of the contact list size.

- **Real-Time Search Updates**  
  As users type, search results refresh dynamically to display contacts that match the current input. This enhances user interaction by providing instant visual feedback.

- **Intuitive Navigation**  
  Designed for seamless navigation, the system allows users to explore contact lists quickly, making it easy to locate information efficiently.

- **Optimized Performance**  
  A combination of efficient search algorithms and real-time updates ensures a responsive experience, meeting the demands of managing large contact databases.

## Summary
The Contact Searching System leverages the **Suffix Tree** structure to deliver an efficient, user-friendly tool for managing contact lists. By focusing on speed and ease of use, it enhances the experience of finding and navigating through contacts, making everyday tasks more convenient.
